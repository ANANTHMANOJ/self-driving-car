# Self Driving Car
 This project is about knowing how the self driving car works. I built this project while I was learning Artificial Intelligence and its Implementation. Here the code demonstrates the working of Self Driving Car in terms of 2D graphics rather than direct implementation to a car. The working of this code is shown in example video further below.
 
 ### Prerequisites
 Knowlegde of Python and implementation of different libraries like torch,kivy and matplotlib will come to use in this project. Working with Python IDE such as Anaconda will make you confortable to code and execute it side by side.  
 ### Installing
 Open the Ananconda prompt and run the following codes in order to install some important libraries,
   
```
 conda install -c peterjc123 pytorch-cpu  
 conda install -c conda-forge kivy
 ```  
 
 ### Brief
 Execution of code will popup a window displaying a car with sensors (rectangle) moving automatically from source (right bottom) to destination (top left). We can draw a path for which the car understands the direction to take, the curves it should handle and drives from source to destination. The three buttons that you will find are used to clear the path drawn, save the learnt info of the car and load the information learnt respectively.
